MoodChat
~~~~~~~~

Workflow:
1. User logins with desired username
2. User joins the channel that keeps track of user and their moods
3. Online list is updated (keeps listening for joins/drops)
4. User sends mood message
  -> The channel is updated with the new mood message

Nothing needs to be done for the setup to work except having access to PHP5 and cURL.

Uses PusherApp and their API for PHP (Pusher-PHP)
